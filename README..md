# 🏦 Bank Management System (C++)

## 📘 Overview
The **Bank Management System** is a simple console-based C++ application designed to perform basic banking operations such as creating new accounts, depositing/withdrawing money, and checking account details.  
It demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **file handling** in C++.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- To automate basic banking operations.  
- To demonstrate the use of **classes, objects, and file handling** in C++.  
- To maintain account data persistently using binary file storage.

✅ Create a new bank account  
✅ Deposit money into an account  
✅ Withdraw money from an account  
✅ Check account balance  
✅ Modify existing account details  
✅ Delete an account  
✅ Display all customer accounts

| Language | C++ |
| Compiler | GCC / Turbo C++ |
| Concepts | Classes, File Handling, Functions, Loops, Conditionals |
| Storage | Binary File (`account.dat`) |

---

## 🧱 Class Structure
**Class Name:** `Account`

| Member | Description |
|---------|-------------|

## 🖥️ How to Run
1. **Save** the code as `bank.cpp`.  
2. **Compile** the code using:
   ```bash
   g++ bank.cpp -o bank
   ```
3. **Run** the program:
   ```bash
   ./bank
   ```
4. A file named `account.dat` will be created automatically to store data.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add **password-protected login system**  
- Add **transaction history logs**  
- Implement **interest and fees calculation**  
- Create a **GUI version** using Qt or SFML  
- Migrate to **database storage** (e.g., MySQL)

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
The **Bank Management System in C++** serves as an excellent demonstration of fundamental programming principles such as OOP, file management, and structured coding.  
It’s an ideal mini project for beginners to understand how data-driven applications work.
